String Vs StringBuffer? https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/string-vs-stringbuffer-vs-stringbuilder
    String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes. 

    StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not. 

    That's why StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer. 

    String concatenation operator (+) internally uses StringBuffer or StringBuilder class.

    The String class is immutable. The StringBuffer class is mutable. 

    String is slow and consumes more memory when we concatenate too many strings because every time it creates new instance. 
    StringBuffer is fast and consumes less memory when we concatenate t strings.
    StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized

What is the concept of statelessness in REST? //https://www.interviewbit.com/rest-api-interview-questions/
What are HTTP Status codes?
    1xx - represents informational responses
    2xx - represents successful responses
    3xx - represents redirects
    4xx - represents client errors
    5xx - represents server errors
What are Idempotent methods? How is it relevant in RESTful web services domain?
    Idempotent methods ensure that the responses to a request if called once or ten times or more than that remain the same. This is equivalent to adding any number with 0.
    REST provides idempotent methods automatically. GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE are the idempotent HTTP methods. POST is not idempotent.


Enums:-  https://www.javainuse.com/misc/enum-interview-questions
    Why do we have the concept of enum?
        Enum is the lists of constants, so it is useful when required to define a list of constants. Enum is useful when list of outcomes is limited.
    Can a constuctor be invoked using an Enum?
        Yes we can use the constuctor with the name of Enum.
    Can we extend an Enum to add elements?
        No, we cannot extend Enum further in the Code. It is defined only with keyword Enum and filled with elements but these elements cannot be added further in the program using some alternative method.
    What does ordinal() method do in Enum?
        Ordinal method returns the order in which Enum instance are declared inside Enum. For example in a DayOfWeek Enum, you can declare days in order they come e.g.


What happens if we do not override hashcode() and equals() in hashmap?
    You must override hashCode in every class that overrides equals.
    Failure to do so will result in a violation of the general contract for Object. hashCode, which will prevent your class from functioning properly in conjunction with all hash-based collections, including HashMap, HashSet, and Hashtable.

Can we use Object as a Key in Hashmap? https://howtodoinjava.com/java/collections/hashmap/design-good-key-for-hashmap/
    A simple thumb rule is to use immutable objects as keys in a HashMap.
    because: If it were mutable, then the hashcode() value or equals() condition might change, and you would never be able to retrieve the key from your HashMap.
