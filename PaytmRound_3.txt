Current Roles and Responsibilites.
More about the Application.
Database Size on the basis of Application.

Most of the question are real life, related to my application and resume only.
Why there is a requirement to use SQL and NoSQL within same application?
What is Order Management System.
Talk about Large Transaction System.
	We have to build search for that TS.
	Table with 100Million Records.
	We have to build search on the top of it, to return result to the user in sub-seconds.
	Design Low level storage model.
	System clusters should be leniently scalable. (Means When data grows, hardware requirement should not grow).
	Should we store 3-5 months old Data in Our Database?
	What if Redis down?
What is cache control headers?
ETag?


Difference b/w post and put?
Why there is a requirement of PUT if we have post?
Why should we not use post when we have to update the Data ?
Do I violate RESTfulness when using POST as UPDATE OR CREATE?
